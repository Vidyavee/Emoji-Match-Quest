# Emoji Match Quest

"Emoji Match Quest" is a fun and memory game where you have to match the same emojis to win the game. It provides an interactive interface for users to play the game and test their memory skills. The project consists of an HTML file (`matchgame.html`), a CSS file (`matchgame.css`), and JavaScript code embedded within the HTML file.

## Overview

The game presents users with a grid of emojis that are initially hidden. Users can click on the emojis to reveal them, and they must remember the location of each emoji to find matching pairs. When two matching emojis are revealed, they remain visible. The game continues until all emojis are matched, at which point the user wins the game.

## Features

- Grid of emojis for matching
- Interactive gameplay
- Win condition when all emojis are matched
- Reset button to replay or reset the game grid

## Usage

To play "Emoji Match Quest", simply open the `matchgame.html` file in a web browser. Click on the emojis to reveal them, and try to match pairs of identical emojis. Use the reset button to replay or reset the game grid.

## File Structure
